### UCLA-CS35L Projects

UCLA CS35L Winter '24 Course

## Emacs & Shell

This assignment involved a series of exercises focused on mastering Emacs, Unix command line tools and file system management. Tasks included manipulating file permissions, exploring system directories, and handling data inputs and outputs effectively. The exercises enhanced practical skills in navigating and utilizing Unix environments for system management.

## Git

This project used Git to manage and explore changes in code repositories. It involved comparing commit histories, identifying and fixing code issues and creating a patch for the corrections. The work demonstrated effective use of Git commands to track changes and resolve issues within codebases.

## Lisp & Python

This project focused on practical applications of Emacs Lisp and Python programming. Tasks involved computing mathematical figures using Emacs Lisp, exploring Emacs keybindings, and enhancing Python scripts for robust file manipulation. The work also included addressing compatibility issues between Python versions and benchmarking scripts to assess performance improvements.

## React

This project is managed by [chorus-lapilli](https://github.com/Jamiezoomies/chorus-lapilli)

## Topological Order

This Python project is designed to explore the commit history of a Git repository without using Git commands directly. It uses Python to traverse and validate the presence of a .git directory, map commit hashes to branch names, and construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of commits. The script performs a topological sort of the commits, starting from the root commits, and then prints the commits in a sorted order with branch details.

## Rand SW/HW

This project advanced a random number generator by integrating both hardware and software RNG methods, enhancing its efficiency and adaptability. Through careful refactoring, the utility now supports dynamic RNG selection based on user preferences, including hardware-assisted rdrand and software-based lrand48 techniques. These enhancements not only improve performance but also ensure greater flexibility in generating random numbers under varied system configurations.
