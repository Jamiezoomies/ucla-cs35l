***Exercise 2.1***

The 14th Perfect number:

(setq perfect-number (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1)))
(+ (logb perfect-number) 1)
1213

The 14th perfect number taks 1213 bits to be represented in base-2 notation.



Examine keybindings in more detail:

'C-h k' runs the command describe-key, displaying documentation for the function invoked by KEY-LIST.
Consequently, typing 'C-h k C-h k' displays documentation for the function invoked by the keybinding 'C-h k' on a new window.

Similarly, typing 'C-h k M-SPC' displays documentation for the function invoked by the keybinding 'M-SPC' on a new window.
According to the documentation, M-SPC runs the 'cycle-spacing' command, which manipulates whitespace around the cursor point in a smart way.

'M-SPC' trims a significant amount of whitespace to a single space.


I could get to the source code using 'M-x find-library RET simple.el RET'



***Exercise 2.2***

M-x what-line shows what line the current cursor is on.




***Homework: Python Scripting***


-What happens when "randline.py" is invoked on an empty file?

It returns IndexError: list index out of range.
An empty file includes no lines.
In python2, when invoking random.py, it raises IndexError because seq is empty.


-What happens when "randline.py" is invoked with Python 3?

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
except IOError as (errno, strerror)

This is because the syntax like this is not allowed in Python 3.


-What happens when your shuf.py script is invoked with Python 2 rather than Python 3, and why?

My shuf.py script is invoked with both Python 2 and Python 3 without any errors.
