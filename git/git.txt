#Lab B

1.
To examine the commits, cloned the repository to the directory ~eggert/src/github/git:

   git clone ~eggert/src/github/git

To reference the logs and details for the graph, used the following command:

   git log --graph 2a7d63^..c03bee --pretty=format:'%H, %an, %cn'



2.
To clone Git's git repository from GitHub, used the following command:

   git clone "https://github.com/git/git.git"


For examining branches in two git repositories, used the following command:

    git branch -a

For the difference, it turned out there's an additional branch called 'remotes/origin/jch' in the git repository cloned from GitHub.
